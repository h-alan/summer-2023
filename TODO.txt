- Read Second Paper
- Try out Z3 tutorial
- Why are not all the data races bogus?
  - Based on sequential consistency, we know that anything that doesn't follow it is bogus and thus we only eliminate bogus warnings 
- o -> o' in encoding is used to indicate value at next step
- All benchmarks are publicly available

- Branch event, what is the problem with the control flow for T2e1?
- Read event, why does e2 matter, can it read garbage data?
- What is F, why do the mappings matter? What do the symbolic values do in this case?
- Is there a P' that can generate T' but not T
- Is prefix closedness helping for data race, T1ab vs T1abT2
- What does paper do for values that don't exist in the formula?
