Sequential Consistency:
- no memory reordering
- Example:
  - x = 0, y = 0
  - Thread 1: x = 1; a = x
  - Thread 2: y = 1; b = y
  All possible outcomes are:
  - a = 0, b = 1
  - a = 1, b = 0
  - a = 1, b = 1
  This is not possible:
  - a = 0, b = 0

Weak Memory Models:
- Real systems have weak memory models
- Allow reorderings of any operation
  Requirements:
  Hardware Memory Models
  - describe real CPUs
  - save room for future optimizations
  - provide reasonable guarantees for PLs
  Programming Language Memory Models
  - support compiler optimizations
  - provide efficient compilation to hardware
  - have easy non-expert mode
  
Non-Expert memory models:
- Nice program -> nice behaviors of the program
- No data races -> only Sequantial Consistent behaviors
